			My name is Austin Guerzon, I did Graphic Design back in Freshman year and really enjoyed that class, so here I am doing web Design now my senior year, I really like this website as I spent very long coding and stuff so yeah, I do Basketball for the school and track and Field for the school, I did soccer but stopped as since it was the same season as basketball, I just chose basketball over soccer. Anyways enjoy the website I am doing this for a grade and perhaps, hopefully, for my future, so enjoy the website and click on the links on top that say "About Me | Favorite Things | Contact Me" I started this website on August 18th 2025.

	There once was a man whose mustache was so grand it seemed to have a life of its own, curling proudly with every word he spoke. One day, his mustache tangled itself around a letter from a mysterious admirer, leading him on an unexpected adventure. With each twist and turn, the mustache guided him through secret paths and hidden truths. In the end, the man realized his mustache wasn’t just facial hair—it was the key to unlocking a new chapter of his life.
