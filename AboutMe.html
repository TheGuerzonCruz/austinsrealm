			I do basketball, varsity basketball for the school and also do Track and Field, I mainly focus on basketball more than track but I don't expect on doing basketball on the next level and more so start working towrds game design or the supply chain, I am also doing for my Economics class a News Paper assignment on how 9/11 affected the economics back in the days

			Popeyes is very good and I could eat it everyday, about like 6-7 decades, I could and would eat Popeyes. If there was a Popeyes basketball team. I would train and practice basketball everyday just for a chance to even try out with Popeyes basketball, I also just wanna go home so I could play the great game of RimWorld, a very good game that i would recommend to many, as the game regenerates a different storyline everytime you play, which is pretty awesome and cool.
