On this page I made a 3x3 gallery page right under my 15 word essay I did in class, as of right now I have 4 pictures that represent me a little bit, using internal css, while creating the pictures as shown, I used photoshop with a basic caption in there to give some more authenticity , I also added that when you hover onto the picture, it shows a little shadow to show that you are hovering over a picture, then when you click on the picture you can expand it giving a closer view on the picture, the images have good resolution so you should not be able to see any pixels, every image has an "alt" text on it which is how I made it so the imae expands I did thise on photoshop making one a thumbnail and one a wide version.
